## About this app

The website provides an in-depth exploration of Angular directives, which are classes that add additional behavior to elements in Angular applications. It covers the three main types of directives:

- Components: Directives with their own templates, forming the building blocks of Angular applications.
- Attribute Directives: Used to alter the appearance or behavior of existing elements, components, or other directives.
- Structural Directives: Responsible for modifying the DOM layout by adding or removing elements.

The site offers practical examples and detailed explanations, serving as a valuable resource for developers seeking to enhance their understanding and application of Angular directives.
